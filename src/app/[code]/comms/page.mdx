## Printable Materials (Desk Drops)

Printed flyers (desk drops) are tangible, physical reminders placed in high-visibility employee areas such as break rooms, restrooms, or directly on desks. They reinforce digital communications and increase overall employee awareness through repeated exposure, reaching employees who may be less responsive to digital-only communications.

<Note>
    **Printable Materials Tip:**
    Distribute flyers widely across multiple common areas to maximize visibility, reach employees during downtime, and encourage immediate action via embedded QR codes.
