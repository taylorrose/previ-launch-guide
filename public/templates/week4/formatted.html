<!-- Intro -->
<p>Hi Team,</p>
<p>
    Final heads up - as mentioned before, <strong>{{deadline}}</strong> is the last day to check out the private phone plan rates we secured.
    I've been able to confirm with Previ that you only <strong>need to click through and create your plan by {{deadline}}</strong>, and you can
    make the actual switch whenever it works best for you while locking in your waived membership.
</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a good option to register by the end of the month if you want to keep the availability of the benefit open for longer.</p>
