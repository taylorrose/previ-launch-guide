        Compare and Save Employee Pricing on Phone Plans + Insurance
    </h2>

    <!-- Intro -->
    <p>Hi team,</p>
    <p>
        We’re expanding your employee benefits.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many of you have already enrolled in Previ for employee pricing on wireless plans. Now, {{employerName}} employees can also unlock exclusive savings on home and auto insurance—through the major carriers and providers.
    </p>

            <img src="/images/wireless_insurance_savings.png" alt="Wireless and Insurance Savings" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 5px;" />
        </a>
    </div>

    <!-- Enrollment Information -->
    <p>
        We have a limited rollout period for employees to waive their annual enrollment fee. Employees can now use Previ’s Bill Compare Tool to see personalized savings. By completing a bill comparison, they will cover your first-year enrollment fee ($99).
    </p>
    <p>
        To lock in free enrollment during the rollout period:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>For wireless:</strong> Upload your phone bill.</li>
        <li><strong>For insurance:</strong> Upload your home or auto policy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Previ will compare your current rate to <strong>private employee pricing</strong> and show you available options. This opportunity is part of the current <strong>enrollment period</strong>, so be sure to explore your options while it’s available.
    </p>
