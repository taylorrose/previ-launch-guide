        Many of you have already enrolled in Previ for employee pricing on wireless plans. Now, {{employerName}} employees can also unlock exclusive savings on home and auto insurance—through the major carriers and providers.

    <!-- Enrollment Information -->
    <p>
        We have a limited rollout period for employees to waive their annual enrollment fee. Employees can now use Previ’s Bill Compare Tool to see personalized savings. By completing a bill comparison, they will cover your first-year enrollment fee ($99).
    </p>
